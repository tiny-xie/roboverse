## What is RoboVerse?

**RoboVerse** is a unified platform for scalable and generalizable robot learning. See the [project page](https://roboverseorg.github.io) and [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18904) for more details.

       style="max-width:100%; height:auto;" />
</p>

The RoboVerse ecosystem consists of three main components:

- **MetaSim**: Core simulation framework with unified API across simulators
- **RoboVerse Pack**: Pre-configured robots, tasks, and scene assets
- **RoboVerse Learn**: Integrated learning algorithms (IL & RL)

Learn more about the architecture in the [Architecture Overview](metasim/concept/architecture.md).
