## Quick Start

### Training with Imitation Learning

```bash
# Collect demonstrations
python scripts/collect_demo.py --task pick_cube --episodes 100

# Train Diffusion Policy
python roboverse_learn/il/train_dp.py \
    --task pick_cube \
    --data_path ./demos/pick_cube \
    --epochs 100
```

### Training with Reinforcement Learning

```bash
# Train PPO on a manipulation task
python roboverse_learn/rl/train_ppo.py \
    --task pick_cube \
    --robot franka \
    --num_envs 1024 \
    --steps 10000000

# Train FastTD3 with MJX backend
python roboverse_learn/rl/train_fast_td3.py \
    --task pick_cube \
    --simulator mjx \
    --num_envs 4096
```

## Features

### Unified Interface

All algorithms share a common interface with MetaSim:

```python
from roboverse_learn.il import DiffusionPolicy
from roboverse_learn.rl import PPO

# IL training
policy = DiffusionPolicy(config)
policy.train(env, demonstrations)

# RL training
agent = PPO(config)
agent.train(env, total_steps=1000000)
```

### GPU-Accelerated Training

- Vectorized environments for parallel data collection
- Batch policy inference on GPU
- Mixed-precision training support

### Experiment Management

- Weights & Biases integration
- TensorBoard logging
- Checkpoint management
- Hyperparameter sweeps

## Installation

Most algorithms are included in the base installation. For specific algorithms:

```bash
# Full IL suite
pip install -e ".[il]"

# Full RL suite
pip install -e ".[rl]"

# Vision-Language models
pip install -e ".[vla]"
```
